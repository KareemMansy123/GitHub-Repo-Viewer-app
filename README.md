# GitHub Repo Viewer App

## Overview
The GitHub Repo Viewer is a mobile application that allows users to browse and view repositories on GitHub. It is designed to demonstrate expertise in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Coroutines Flow with Channel and LiveData, MVVM + MVI architecture, Retrofit, Room Database, Koin, and unit testing.

## Features
- **Repository Browsing**: Effortlessly browse through a list of GitHub repositories.
- **Detailed View**: Tap on a repository to see detailed information.
- **Offline Access**: Access cached repositories even when offline.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and modern user interface built with Jetpack Compose.
- **Seamless Integration**: Utilizes Retrofit for network calls and Room for caching.
- **Robust Architecture**: Implements MVVM + MVI for clear separation of concerns.
- **Reactive Programming**: Leverages Coroutines Flow and LiveData for reactive UI updates.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Koin for concise and maintainable dependency injection.
- **Unit Tested**: Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and quality.
